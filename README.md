# mgs4-dlss

Real DLSS (DLAA and the upscaling modes) for the PC port of *Metal Gear Solid 4* (Master Collection Vol. 2), built as a ReShade add-on. The NGX feature it creates can be hooked by NGX-based add-ons — **directly compatible with the DLSS 5 Neural Rendering add-on (`renodx-dlss5.addon64`)**, which is auto-detected: with it loaded, DLAA runs on the final image so NR works at full strength.

## Status

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| Route A — run the port on bgfx's built-in Direct3D 12 backend | **Done** — `d3d12-switch/` |
| Phase 0 — map the frame (scene target, depth, composite draw) | **Done** — see docs |
| Phase 1a — NGX DLSS (DLAA) created + evaluated every frame, NGX add-ons can hook it | **Done** — `dlss-addon/` (v1: zero jitter / zero motion vectors) |
| Phase 1b — camera jitter + camera-only motion vectors | **Implemented** (needs visual tuning) — see below |
| In-overlay controls (ReShade Add-ons tab) | **Done** |
| Phase 2 — per-object motion vectors | planned |
| Phase 3 — real upscaling (internal res < output res) | maybe |

See [docs/renderer-notes.md](docs/renderer-notes.md) for what we know about the port and the full plan.

## dlss-addon (`mgs4_dlss.addon64`)

A ReShade add-on (API 20, D3D12 only) that creates a real NGX DLSS Super Resolution feature (DLAA, preset K) and evaluates it every frame:

1. Tracks what bgfx binds per command list (RT/DS, viewport, root descriptor tables, root CBVs, root signature, PSO).
2. Mirrors bgfx's `CopyDescriptors` traffic (`copy_descriptor_tables` event) into its own slot→resource map, because ReShade does not register copied CBV/SRV/UAV descriptors in its view map. That makes the SRVs of any draw resolvable.
3. At the one draw per frame into the backbuffer-sized target (the 1:1 composite of the finished 3840x2160 frame, UI included), resolves the texture that draw samples — a double-buffered final texture, *not* the render target with the most draws — pairs it with the depth buffer that was bound with it, and calls `NGX_D3D12_EVALUATE_DLSS_EXT` with color/depth/(zero) motion vectors.
4. Copies the DLSS output over the sampled texture, then natively re-applies bgfx's descriptor heaps, root signature, PSO and root parameters so the composite draw is unaffected.
5. Re-creates the feature once after 120 evaluations: NGX-hooking add-ons install their hooks when `nvngx_dlss.dll` loads (inside our first `CreateFeature`), so they would otherwise never see the create call that carries the "DLSS contract".

Because the NGX calls go through the standard `_nvngx.dll` exports, NGX-hooking add-ons see them: `renodx-dlss5` reports `DLSSNR ACTIVE`, creates its NR feature after ours and evaluates it every frame.

Verified 2026-08-28: NGX init OK on RTX 5090 / 616.56, `CreateFeature` OK, ~120 evaluations/s (≈80 with DLSS 5 NR active), HUD/UI intact, and `DebugMode=1` paints the displayed image magenta (proves the insertion path).

### Build / install

Requirements: MSVC Build Tools (the `build.bat` calls `vcvars64.bat` from VS 18 BuildTools — adjust the path if yours differs), ReShade 6.8 installed as `MGS4\dxgi.dll`, the D3D12 switch above, and `nvngx_dlss.dll` in `MGS4\` (copy `third_party/DLSS/lib/Windows_x86_64/rel/nvngx_dlss.dll` or let the NVIDIA app override supply it).

```bat
dlss-addon\build.bat                       :: -> build\mgs4_dlss.addon64
copy build\mgs4_dlss.addon64 "<game>\MGS4\"
```

`MGS4\mgs4_dlss.ini`:

```ini
[DLSS]
Enabled=1                ; live-reloaded every ~second
Mode=DLAA                ; DLAA (=Native) | Quality | Balanced | Performance | UltraPerformance  - needs a game restart
InternalRes=3840x2160    ; size of the game's render targets = your in-game resolution; auto-detected and written on first run
Preset=11                ; NVSDK_NGX_DLSS_Hint_Render_Preset_K (transformer). 10 = J
Sharpness=0              ; 0..100 (live)
LogEveryN=600
RecreateAfter=120
DebugMode=0              ; live: 1 = magenta path test, 2 = bypass DLSS (A/B), 3 = trace 3 frames, 4 = analyse draw constants
Jitter=1                 ; live: Halton camera jitter patched into scene draw constants
JitterSignX=1            ; NDC sign conventions (defaults follow the DLSS/Unreal convention)
JitterSignY=-1
MotionVectors=1          ; live: camera-only motion vectors from depth (compute pass)
```

Log: `MGS4\logs\mgs4_dlss.log`.

### DLSS modes (upscaling)

`Mode` other than DLAA makes the game render smaller and lets DLSS upscale:

1. At device creation NGX's optimal settings give the render resolution for the mode (e.g. 3840x2160 Quality -> 2560x1440, Performance -> 1920x1080, Ultra Performance -> 1280x720).
2. Every texture the game creates at `InternalRes` is shrunk to the render resolution (`create_resource` event); viewports and scissors of draws into shrunk targets are scaled to match.
3. At the composite draw DLSS upscales the shrunk final texture into a full-size output and the draw's SRV descriptor is rewritten in place to sample that output, so the composite and the backbuffer are untouched.

Because the game's render-target size follows the in-game resolution, `InternalRes` must match it; the add-on writes the detected value to the ini whenever it differs (change resolution in-game -> restart once). Verified in Performance mode (1512x850 -> 3024x1701): correct composition, HUD and pillarboxing; other modes use the same path but were not individually tested.

**Expect it to look soft.** Without sub-pixel jitter DLSS has no extra information to reconstruct detail from, so the upscaling modes currently behave like a good temporal upscaler with no supersampling. They are useful for testing NR/DLSS at lower cost, not for image quality yet - DLAA is the quality mode until jitter lands. On an RTX 5090 the game is not GPU-bound anyway.

### Frame generation (not implemented - here is why)

- **2x today:** NVIDIA Smooth Motion (driver-level, RTX 40/50, works on DX12 titles without game support): NVIDIA App -> Graphics -> `mgs4.exe` -> Driver Settings -> Smooth Motion. Nothing to install.
- **DLSS Frame Generation / Multi-Frame Generation (2x/3x/4x)** is only exposed through NVIDIA Streamline (`sl.dlssg`), not through the plain NGX API this add-on uses. Doing it from an add-on means initialising Streamline in-process, letting it take over the DXGI swapchain (which ReShade also proxies), and feeding it **real motion vectors + depth + HUD-less color** every frame. With this game's zero motion vectors the generated frames would be wrong on any camera movement, so it makes no sense before Phase 1b (camera motion vectors) exists. It is a separate project on the order of the DLSS integration itself.
- Alternative once motion vectors exist: OptiScaler (loaded as `winmm.dll`, which the game imports) can hook the NGX DLSS feature this add-on creates and provide FSR/XeSS frame generation.

### Overlay controls

The add-on has its own panel in ReShade's **Add-ons** tab (Home key): Enable, DLSS mode (applies on restart — the game creates its render targets once at startup; the panel says so when the selection differs from the active mode), DLSS preset (J/K, applied live by re-creating the feature), sharpness, camera jitter, camera motion vectors, debug modes, and live status (feature size, evaluations/s, jitter, VP detection, MV resets). Every control writes `mgs4_dlss.ini`.

### Phase 1b: camera jitter and camera-only motion vectors

Scene draws carry a row-major clip matrix (rows = clip x, y, z, w) in their vertex constants — `c[0..3]` for the main
geometry shaders, `c[1..4]` for others. It is recognisable without knowing the shader: the w-row's xyz is a unit vector
(view-space depth direction) and the z-row has no x/y (reversed-Z, `z_clip = near`). Per frame the add-on:

1. Patches every scene draw's matrix in bgfx's upload heap once per constant region: `row_x += ox·row_w`,
   `row_y += oy·row_w` with `ox = +2·jx/W`, `oy = −2·jy/H` (Halton 2,3; 8 phases at DLAA), and reports `(jx, jy)` to
   DLSS. This is the same convention as Unreal's DLSS integration. `JitterSignX/Y` in the ini flip it if needed.
2. Picks the frame's view-projection by majority vote over the `c[0]` blocks (identity-model geometry), keeps the
   previous frame's, and runs a compute pass (`src/mv_cs.hlsl`) that reprojects each depth pixel through
   `prevVP · inv(VP)` into camera-only motion vectors (pixels, pointing to the previous position).
3. Detects camera cuts (view direction or offset jumps) and raises `InReset`.

State of tuning: ~60–75% of scene draws expose a recognisable matrix; the rest (HUD/orthographic draws, one shader family
with a different constant layout) render unjittered, so overlay elements can look slightly softer with jitter on.
Character animation still has no motion vectors (Phase 2). Use the overlay toggles to compare.

### Known limitations

- Per-object motion (characters) has no motion vectors yet; expect ghosting on fast character movement.
- `Mode` changes need a restart (render targets are created at startup).
- `steam_appid.txt` (2492670) is placed next to `mgs4.exe` so the exe can be launched directly for testing; harmless for Steam launches.

## d3d12-switch (`MGS4_D3D12.asi`)

The port renders through [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) and picks Direct3D 11. bgfx tries backends in score order (D3D11, then D3D12, …) and moves on when one fails to create a device. The ASI hooks the system `d3d11.dll`'s `D3D11CreateDevice` / `D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain` and returns `E_FAIL` for calls that carry `D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_SINGLETHREADED` (0x1 — bgfx passes 0x21), so bgfx falls through to its D3D12 backend. Nothing else is patched.

Verified 2026-08-28: game boots and renders the title/intro on D3D12 (`ReShade.log` shows `D3D12CreateDevice`, `D3D12Core.dll` loaded); MGSFPSUnlock, ReShade and `renodx-dlss5.addon64` load alongside.

### Build / install

Requirements: mingw-w64 `gcc` on PATH (Git Bash), [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) as `MGS4/d3d11.dll`.

```sh
sh d3d12-switch/build.sh      # -> build/MGS4_D3D12.asi
sh d3d12-switch/install.sh    # copies asi + ini to MGS4/scripts/ (override with MGS4_DIR=...)
```

Revert to stock D3D11: set `Enabled = 0` in `MGS4/scripts/MGS4_D3D12.ini`. Log: `MGS4/logs/MGS4_D3D12.log`.

### Phase 2 (first step): character mask

Skinned meshes (PSOs whose input layout has `BLENDWEIGHT`/`BLENDINDICES`, reported by ReShade at pipeline creation)
are replayed once into a private depth buffer (same PSO, same jittered constants, no colour target). The motion-vector
pass turns that depth into DLSS's **bias-current-colour mask**, so DLSS leans on the current frame for character
pixels instead of reprojected history that camera-only vectors cannot describe. Result: no halo/ghosting around
characters, at the cost of a little temporal accumulation on them. Options (panel / ini): `DynamicMask` (default on),
`DynamicMaskProps` (also mask props with their own model matrix — off; static props are correct with camera vectors),
`DynamicZeroMV` (zero motion on masked pixels — off; useful for third-person camera turns where the player stays
centred). The MV visualiser (`DebugMode=5`) shows the mask in blue. True per-object velocity remains future work.

### DLAA insertion point (pre-HUD)

In DLAA mode DLSS runs *before* post-processing and the HUD: the frame's geometry target is detected in-frame (first
depth-bound RT reaching 40% of last frame's peak draw count — the port multi-buffers these targets, so "last frame's"
never matches) and DLSS is inserted at the first draw that samples it, or at the first 2D draw into it, whichever
comes first. Draws issued after the insertion (transparents, particles, HUD) are left unjittered. Upscaling modes keep
the composite insertion (they need the SRV redirect).

### DLSS 5 NR vs. pre-HUD insertion (auto)

`renodx-dlss5` runs its NR pass on whatever DLSS evaluates. With the pre-HUD insertion that is the raw scene, and the
game's DOF, colour grading and vignette are applied afterwards, which flattens the NR effect (faces in particular).
So the insertion point is **automatic** (`PrePost=auto`): if `renodx-dlss5.addon64` is loaded in the process, DLAA runs
at the composite so NR gets the final image; without it, DLAA runs pre-post for the cleanest AA (vignette/HUD outside
DLSS). Override with the "Insertion point" combo in the panel or `PrePost=1` / `PrePost=0`.

### Direct stage boot

`mgs4.exe --stage <name>` skips the launcher and menus: `s00title_1` (OTC intro), `s00a00l` (cemetery opening),
`s01a00l` (Act 1 start), ... (names listed in the exe). `steam_appid.txt` next to the exe keeps Steam from
relaunching. A desktop shortcut "MGS4 (stage s00a00l)" boots straight into the cemetery for quick tests.

`tools\launch_stage.ps1` automates a test setup: boots a stage, waits for the game window, then taps Enter every
0.5 s until the add-on log reports the first 3D frame (auto-save notice and title are gone, the cutscene is running),
for at most 60 s. Keys go through `keybd_event` with the window forced to the foreground - this port ignores
scan-code `SendInput` events. Explicit sequences also work:
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\launch_stage.ps1 -Stage s00a00l -Keys "5,ENTER,4,ENTER"`
(`-NoRestart` sends the keys to the running game; log in `MGS4\logs\launch_stage.log`).

### Robustness

Level transitions destroy and recreate render targets; every cross-frame handle (busiest/geometry/final targets, last
depth, RT->depth map, descriptor-copy map) is validated against the set of live textures and dropped on destruction.

# mgs4-dlss

Work toward real DLSS (DLAA first) in the PC port of *Metal Gear Solid 4* (Master Collection Vol. 2), so the game can be hooked by NGX-based add-ons such as `renodx-dlss5`.

## Status

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| Route A — run the port on bgfx's built-in Direct3D 12 backend | **Done** — `d3d12-switch/` |
| Phase 0 — map the frame (scene target, depth, composite draw) | **Done** — see docs |
| Phase 1a — NGX DLSS (DLAA) created + evaluated every frame, NGX add-ons can hook it | **Done** — `dlss-addon/` (v1: zero jitter / zero motion vectors) |
| Phase 1b — camera jitter + camera-only motion vectors | next |
| Phase 2 — per-object motion vectors | planned |
| Phase 3 — real upscaling (internal res < output res) | maybe |

See [docs/renderer-notes.md](docs/renderer-notes.md) for what we know about the port and the full plan.

## dlss-addon (`mgs4_dlss.addon64`)

A ReShade add-on (API 20, D3D12 only) that creates a real NGX DLSS Super Resolution feature (DLAA, preset K) and evaluates it every frame:

1. Tracks what bgfx binds per command list (RT/DS, viewport, root descriptor tables, root CBVs, root signature, PSO).
2. Mirrors bgfx's `CopyDescriptors` traffic (`copy_descriptor_tables` event) into its own slot→resource map, because ReShade does not register copied CBV/SRV/UAV descriptors in its view map. That makes the SRVs of any draw resolvable.
3. At the one draw per frame into the backbuffer-sized target (the 1:1 composite of the finished 3840x2160 frame, UI included), resolves the texture that draw samples — a double-buffered final texture, *not* the render target with the most draws — pairs it with the depth buffer that was bound with it, and calls `NGX_D3D12_EVALUATE_DLSS_EXT` with color/depth/(zero) motion vectors.
4. Copies the DLSS output over the sampled texture, then natively re-applies bgfx's descriptor heaps, root signature, PSO and root parameters so the composite draw is unaffected.
5. Re-creates the feature once after 120 evaluations: NGX-hooking add-ons install their hooks when `nvngx_dlss.dll` loads (inside our first `CreateFeature`), so they would otherwise never see the create call that carries the "DLSS contract".

Because the NGX calls go through the standard `_nvngx.dll` exports, NGX-hooking add-ons see them: `renodx-dlss5` reports `DLSSNR ACTIVE`, creates its NR feature after ours and evaluates it every frame.

Verified 2026-08-28: NGX init OK on RTX 5090 / 616.56, `CreateFeature` OK, ~120 evaluations/s (≈80 with DLSS 5 NR active), HUD/UI intact, and `DebugMode=1` paints the displayed image magenta (proves the insertion path).

### Build / install

Requirements: MSVC Build Tools (the `build.bat` calls `vcvars64.bat` from VS 18 BuildTools — adjust the path if yours differs), ReShade 6.8 installed as `MGS4\dxgi.dll`, the D3D12 switch above, and `nvngx_dlss.dll` in `MGS4\` (copy `third_party/DLSS/lib/Windows_x86_64/rel/nvngx_dlss.dll` or let the NVIDIA app override supply it).

```bat
dlss-addon\build.bat                       :: -> build\mgs4_dlss.addon64
copy build\mgs4_dlss.addon64 "<game>\MGS4\"
```

`MGS4\mgs4_dlss.ini`:

```ini
[DLSS]
Enabled=1                ; live-reloaded every ~second
Mode=DLAA                ; DLAA (=Native) | Quality | Balanced | Performance | UltraPerformance  - needs a game restart
InternalRes=3840x2160    ; size of the game's render targets = your in-game resolution; auto-detected and written on first run
Preset=11                ; NVSDK_NGX_DLSS_Hint_Render_Preset_K (transformer). 10 = J
Sharpness=0              ; 0..100 (live)
LogEveryN=600
RecreateAfter=120
DebugMode=0              ; live: 1 = paint the displayed texture magenta (path test), 2 = bypass DLSS (A/B), 3 = trace 3 frames
```

Log: `MGS4\logs\mgs4_dlss.log`.

### DLSS modes (upscaling)

`Mode` other than DLAA makes the game render smaller and lets DLSS upscale:

1. At device creation NGX's optimal settings give the render resolution for the mode (e.g. 3840x2160 Quality -> 2560x1440, Performance -> 1920x1080, Ultra Performance -> 1280x720).
2. Every texture the game creates at `InternalRes` is shrunk to the render resolution (`create_resource` event); viewports and scissors of draws into shrunk targets are scaled to match.
3. At the composite draw DLSS upscales the shrunk final texture into a full-size output and the draw's SRV descriptor is rewritten in place to sample that output, so the composite and the backbuffer are untouched.

Because the game's render-target size follows the in-game resolution, `InternalRes` must match it; the add-on writes the detected value to the ini whenever it differs (change resolution in-game -> restart once). Verified in Performance mode (1512x850 -> 3024x1701): correct composition, HUD and pillarboxing; other modes use the same path but were not individually tested.

**Expect it to look soft.** Without sub-pixel jitter DLSS has no extra information to reconstruct detail from, so the upscaling modes currently behave like a good temporal upscaler with no supersampling. They are useful for testing NR/DLSS at lower cost, not for image quality yet - DLAA is the quality mode until jitter lands. On an RTX 5090 the game is not GPU-bound anyway.

### Frame generation (not implemented - here is why)

- **2x today:** NVIDIA Smooth Motion (driver-level, RTX 40/50, works on DX12 titles without game support): NVIDIA App -> Graphics -> `mgs4.exe` -> Driver Settings -> Smooth Motion. Nothing to install.
- **DLSS Frame Generation / Multi-Frame Generation (2x/3x/4x)** is only exposed through NVIDIA Streamline (`sl.dlssg`), not through the plain NGX API this add-on uses. Doing it from an add-on means initialising Streamline in-process, letting it take over the DXGI swapchain (which ReShade also proxies), and feeding it **real motion vectors + depth + HUD-less color** every frame. With this game's zero motion vectors the generated frames would be wrong on any camera movement, so it makes no sense before Phase 1b (camera motion vectors) exists. It is a separate project on the order of the DLSS integration itself.
- Alternative once motion vectors exist: OptiScaler (loaded as `winmm.dll`, which the game imports) can hook the NGX DLSS feature this add-on creates and provide FSR/XeSS frame generation.

### Known limitations

- No sub-pixel jitter and zero motion vectors: DLSS behaves as a temporal filter with no sub-pixel information, so static shots converge cleanly but camera/object motion ghosts, and upscaling modes are soft. Phase 1b adds Halton jitter via the projection upload and camera-only motion vectors reconstructed from depth.
- `Mode` changes need a restart (render targets are created at startup).

## d3d12-switch (`MGS4_D3D12.asi`)

The port renders through [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) and picks Direct3D 11. bgfx tries backends in score order (D3D11, then D3D12, …) and moves on when one fails to create a device. The ASI hooks the system `d3d11.dll`'s `D3D11CreateDevice` / `D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain` and returns `E_FAIL` for calls that carry `D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_SINGLETHREADED` (0x1 — bgfx passes 0x21), so bgfx falls through to its D3D12 backend. Nothing else is patched.

Verified 2026-08-28: game boots and renders the title/intro on D3D12 (`ReShade.log` shows `D3D12CreateDevice`, `D3D12Core.dll` loaded); MGSFPSUnlock, ReShade and `renodx-dlss5.addon64` load alongside.

### Build / install

Requirements: mingw-w64 `gcc` on PATH (Git Bash), [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) as `MGS4/d3d11.dll`.

```sh
sh d3d12-switch/build.sh      # -> build/MGS4_D3D12.asi
sh d3d12-switch/install.sh    # copies asi + ini to MGS4/scripts/ (override with MGS4_DIR=...)
```

Revert to stock D3D11: set `Enabled = 0` in `MGS4/scripts/MGS4_D3D12.ini`. Log: `MGS4/logs/MGS4_D3D12.log`.
